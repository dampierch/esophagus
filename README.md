# Enhancers Modulating Esophageal Cancer Risk

This repository stores luciferase reporter assay analysis code.

## Data

Data is not currently pushed to GitHub but will be once published.
Collected from OE19 and OE33 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Each putative enhancer element tested in forward and reverse orientations.
Each allele cloned three times.
Each clone measured three times.
Experiment performed one time for negative results and three times for positive
results.

## Code

Allele specific enhancer activity is tested using generalized estimating
equations to account for the expected correlation between different
measurements of the same clones and repeated experiments.
